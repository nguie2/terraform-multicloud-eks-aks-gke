# ADR-001: Multi-Cloud Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

As organizations increasingly rely on cloud infrastructure, the decision of whether to adopt a single-cloud or multi-cloud strategy has become critical. This ADR documents the decision to implement a multi-cloud Kubernetes infrastructure spanning AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-cloud Kubernetes strategy using:
- **AWS EKS** for primary workloads with Karpenter autoscaling
- **Azure AKS** for European data residency requirements
- **Google GKE** for machine learning and data analytics workloads
- **Cross-cloud networking** via Megaport for private connectivity
- **Unified observability** across all cloud providers

## Rationale

### Business Drivers

1. **Vendor Lock-in Avoidance**
   - Reduces dependency on any single cloud provider
   - Provides negotiation leverage with cloud vendors
   - Enables workload portability between clouds

2. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Eliminates single points of failure at the cloud provider level
   - Provides disaster recovery capabilities across regions and providers
   - Reduces impact of cloud provider outages

3. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Enables data residency compliance (GDPR in Europe via Azure)
   - Supports data sovereignty requirements
   - Facilitates compliance with industry-specific regulations

4. **Cost Optimization**
   - Leverages competitive pricing across providers
   - Enables workload placement based on cost efficiency
   - Provides access to different pricing models (spot, reserved, committed use)

5. **Best-of-Breed Services**
   - AWS: Mature ecosystem, extensive service catalog
   - Azure: Enterprise integration, hybrid cloud capabilities
   - GCP: Advanced AI/ML services, data analytics

### Technical Drivers

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Workload placement closer to users globally
   - Leverages provider-specific performance optimizations
   - Enables latency-sensitive application distribution

2. **Innovation Access**
   - Access to cutting-edge services from all providers
   - Ability to adopt new technologies as they become available
   - Reduced time-to-market for new features

3. **Scalability**
   - Combined capacity across multiple cloud providers
   - Ability to scale beyond single-provider limits
   - Geographic distribution for global applications

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Deploy core infrastructure on AWS EKS
- Implement monitoring and observability stack
- Establish CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows

### Phase 2: Multi-Cloud Expansion (Months 3-4)
- Deploy Azure AKS cluster with cross-cloud networking
- Implement unified identity and access management
- Establish cross-cloud monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: Full Multi-Cloud (Months 5-6)
- Deploy Google GKE cluster
- Implement complete cross-cloud networking mesh
- Deploy production workloads across all clouds

### Phase 4: Optimization (Months 7-8)
- Implement intelligent workload placement
- Optimize costs across all providers
- Establish disaster recovery procedures

## Architecture Principles

### Cloud-Agnostic Design
- Use Kubernetes-native APIs and resources
- Avoid cloud-specific services where possible
- Implement abstraction layers for cloud-specific functionality

### Infrastructure as Code
- All infrastructure defined in Terraform/Terragrunt
- Version-controlled infrastructure changes
- Automated deployment and rollback capabilities

### Observability First
- Unified monitoring across all clouds
- Centralized logging and distributed tracing
- Comprehensive alerting and incident response

### Security by Design
- Zero-trust network architecture
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Comprehensive audit logging and compliance monitoring

## Technology Choices

### Container Orchestration

- **Managed Services**: EKS, AKS, GKE for operational simplicity
- **Service Mesh**: Linkerd for cross-cluster communication

### Networking
- **CNI**: Cilium for eBPF-based high-performance networking
- **Cross-Cloud**: Megaport for private, high-bandwidth connectivity
- **Load Balancing**: Cloud-native load balancers with global distribution

### Storage
- **Persistent Storage**: Cloud-native storage classes (EBS, Azure Disk, GCP PD)
- **Object Storage**: S3, Azure Blob, GCS for application data
- **Backup**: Cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Metrics**: VictoriaMetrics for high-performance metrics storage
- **Logging**: Vector for log collection and routing
- **Tracing**: Grafana Tempo for distributed tracing
- **Visualization**: Grafana for unified dashboards

### Security
- **Policy Engine**: OPA Gatekeeper for policy enforcement
- **Runtime Security**: Falco for threat detection
- **Image Security**: Trivy for vulnerability scanning
- **Compliance**: CloudQuery for audit and compliance reporting
