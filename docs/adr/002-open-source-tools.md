# ADR-002: Open Source Tool Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context

In building a multi-cloud Kubernetes infrastructure, we must choose between proprietary cloud-native services and open-source alternatives. This decision significantly impacts vendor lock-in, cost, flexibility, and long-term maintainability. This ADR documents our commitment to using 100% open-source tools wherever possible.

## Decision

We will prioritize open-source tools and technologies across all layers of our infrastructure stack, specifically choosing:

### Container Orchestration & Runtime
- **Kubernetes** (Apache-2.0) over proprietary orchestration platforms
- **containerd** (Apache-2.0) as container runtime
- **Linkerd** (Apache-2.0) for service mesh over Istio or proprietary solutions

### Networking
- **Cilium** (Apache-2.0) for CNI and network policies
- **MetalLB** (Apache-2.0) for load balancing where applicable
- **CoreDNS** (Apache-2.0) for DNS resolution

### Monitoring & Observability
- **VictoriaMetrics** (Apache-2.0) over Prometheus for metrics storage
- **Grafana** (AGPL-3.0) for visualization and dashboards
- **Grafana Tempo** (AGPL-3.0) for distributed tracing
- **Vector** (MPL-2.0) for log collection and routing
- **Alertmanager** (Apache-2.0) for alert management

### Security & Compliance
- **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** (Apache-2.0) with Gatekeeper for policy enforcement
- **Falco** (Apache-2.0) for runtime security monitoring
- **Trivy** (Apache-2.0) for vulnerability scanning
- **CloudQuery** (MPL-2.0) for compliance auditing

### Storage & Data
- **MinIO** (AGPL-3.0) for object storage when cloud-agnostic solution needed
- **PostgreSQL** (PostgreSQL License) for relational databases
- **Redis** (BSD-3-Clause) for caching and session storage

### CI/CD & GitOps
- **ArgoCD** (Apache-2.0) for GitOps deployments
- **Tekton** (Apache-2.0) for CI/CD pipelines
